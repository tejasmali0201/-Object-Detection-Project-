# Object-Detection-Project
Model: Utilizes the YOLOv3 deep learning model for real-time object detection.
Dataset: Employs the COCO dataset for identifying and labeling multiple object classes.
Image Preprocessing: Converts input images into a blob format optimized for the YOLO model.
Object Detection: Processes the image to detect objects, compute confidence scores, and classify objects.
Post-Processing: Applies Non-Maximum Suppression (NMS) to refine detections and remove overlapping bounding boxes.
Visualization: Draws labeled bounding boxes on detected objects with confidence scores.
Applications: Can be applied in areas like surveillance, inventory tracking, and smart farming.
